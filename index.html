          <p class="first-paragraph">I am a registered nurse turned computer programmer, always looking for new things to learn and new challenges to take on. Having worked in the medical field for the last 9+ years I have developed a keen ability to use critical thinking to solve everything from simple issues to complex problems, even in emergent situations. I have been trained to examine small details as well as "the big picture" to determine how these things will affect the overall patient experience and outcome. I am in constant communication with the multiple staff members who form part of the patient's interdisciplinary team, therefore communication skills are indispensable and something that year after year I've had the opportunity to improve.   </p>
          <p class="second-paragraph">I feel very fortunate to have worked as a nurse for as long as I have, and to have had the opportunity to fine-tune skills that I know will undoubtedly help me in this new career. As a nurse I have worked with groups of all kinds of different people (some easier to work with than others) to figure out how to solve difficult problems, and I feel this experience will undoubtedly help me in this new career that seemingly has little in common with medicine. I'm excited about this new chapter in my life, to once again learn something completely new and build a successful career out of it. </p>
